			<h2>Overview of Picard command-line tools</h2>
			<section>

			<p>The Picard command-line tools are packaged as executable jar files.  They require Java
			1.6.  They can be invoked as follows:</p>
			<pre>java <i>jvm-args</i> -jar <i>PicardCommand</i>.jar OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...</pre>
			<p>Most of the commands are designed to run in 2GB of JVM, so the JVM argument -Xmx2g is
			recommended.</p>
