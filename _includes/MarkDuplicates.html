<h3 id="MarkDuplicates">MarkDuplicates</h3>
<section>
<p>Identifies duplicate reads.  <p>This tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a BAM or SAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from a single fragment of DNA.  Duplicates can arise during sample preparation e.g. library construction using PCR.  See also <a href='https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#EstimateLibraryComplexity'>EstimateLibraryComplexity</a> for additional notes on PCR duplication artifacts.  Duplicate reads can also result from a single amplification cluster, incorrectly detected as multiple clusters by the optical sensor of the sequencing instrument.  These duplication artifacts are referred to as optical duplicates.</p><p>The MarkDuplicates tool works by comparing sequences in the 5 prime positions of both reads and read-pairs in a SAM/BAM file.  An BARCODE_TAG option is available to facilitate duplicate marking using molecular barcodes.  After duplicate reads are collected, the tool differentiates the primary and duplicate reads using an algorithm that ranks reads by the sums of their base-quality scores (default method).</p>  <p>The tool's main output is a new SAM or BAM file, in which duplicates have been identified in the SAM flags field for each read.  Duplicates are marked with the hexadecimal value of 0x0400, which corresponds to a decimal value of 1024.  If you are not familiar with this type of annotation, please see the following <a href='https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=7019'>blog post</a> for additional information.</p><p>Although the bitwise flag annotation indicates whether a read was marked as a duplicate, it does not identify the type of duplicate.  To do this, a new tag called the duplicate type (DT) tag was recently added as an optional output in  the 'optional field' section of a SAM/BAM file.  Invoking the TAGGING_POLICY option, you can instruct the program to mark all the duplicates (All), only the optical duplicates (OpticalOnly), or no duplicates (DontTag).  The records within the output of a SAM/BAM file will have values for the 'DT' tag (depending on the invoked TAGGING_POLICY), as either library/PCR-generated duplicates (LB), or sequencing-platform artifact duplicates (SQ).  This tool uses the READ_NAME_REGEX and the OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE options as the primary methods to identify and differentiate duplicate types.  Set READ_NAME_REGEX to null to skip optical duplicate detection, e.g. for RNA-seq or other data where duplicate sets are extremely large and estimating library complexity is not an aim.  Note that without optical duplicate counts, library size estimation will be inaccurate.</p> <p>MarkDuplicates also produces a metrics file indicating the numbers of duplicates for both single- and paired-end reads.</p>  <p>The program can take either coordinate-sorted or query-sorted inputs, however the behavior is slightly different.  When the input is coordinate-sorted, unmapped mates of mapped records and supplementary/secondary alignments are not marked as duplicates.  However, when the input is query-sorted (actually query-grouped), then unmapped mates and secondary/supplementary reads are not excluded from the duplication test and can be marked as duplicate reads.</p>  <p>If desired, duplicates can be removed using the REMOVE_DUPLICATE and REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES options.</p><h4>Usage example:</h4><pre>java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates \<br />      I=input.bam \<br />      O=marked_duplicates.bam \<br />      M=marked_dup_metrics.txt</pre>Please see <a href='http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html#DuplicationMetrics'>MarkDuplicates</a> for detailed explanations of the output metrics.<hr /></p>

<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>MAX_SEQUENCES_FOR_DISK_READ_ENDS_MAP (Integer)</td><td>This option is obsolete. ReadEnds will always be spilled to disk.  Default value: 50000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>MAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP (Integer)</td><td>Maximum number of file handles to keep open when spilling read ends to disk. Set this number a little lower than the per-process maximum number of file that may be open. This number can be found by executing the 'ulimit -n' command on a Unix system.  Default value: 8000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>SORTING_COLLECTION_SIZE_RATIO (Double)</td><td>This number, plus the maximum RAM available to the JVM, determine the memory footprint used by some of the sorting collections.  If you are running out of memory, try reducing this number.  Default value: 0.25. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>BARCODE_TAG (String)</td><td>Barcode SAM tag (ex. BC for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_ONE_BARCODE_TAG (String)</td><td>Read one barcode SAM tag (ex. BX for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_TWO_BARCODE_TAG (String)</td><td>Read two barcode SAM tag (ex. BX for 10X Genomics)  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>TAG_DUPLICATE_SET_MEMBERS (Boolean)</td><td>If a read appears in a duplicate set, add two tags. The first tag, DUPLICATE_SET_SIZE_TAG (DS), indicates the size of the duplicate set. The smallest possible DS value is 2 which occurs when two reads map to the same portion of the reference only one of which is marked as duplicate. The second tag, DUPLICATE_SET_INDEX_TAG (DI), represents a unique identifier for the duplicate set to which the record belongs. This identifier is the index-in-file of the representative read that was selected out of the duplicate set.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES (Boolean)</td><td>If true remove 'optical' duplicates and other duplicates that appear to have arisen from the sequencing process instead of the library preparation process, even if REMOVE_DUPLICATES is false. If REMOVE_DUPLICATES is true, all duplicates are removed and this option is ignored.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>TAGGING_POLICY (DuplicateTaggingPolicy)</td><td>Determines how duplicate types are recorded in the DT optional attribute.  Default value: DontTag. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {DontTag, OpticalOnly, All} </td></tr>
<tr><td>INPUT (String)</td><td>One or more input SAM or BAM files to analyze. Must be coordinate sorted.  Default value: null. This option may be specified 0 or more times. </td></tr>
<tr><td>OUTPUT (File)</td><td>The output file to write marked records to  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>METRICS_FILE (File)</td><td>File to write duplication metrics to  Required. </td></tr>

<tr><td>ASSUME_SORTED (Boolean)</td><td>If true, assume that the input file is coordinate sorted even if the header says otherwise. Deprecated, used ASSUME_SORT_ORDER=coordinate instead.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) ASSUME_SORT_ORDER (ASO)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ASSUME_SORT_ORDER (SortOrder)</td><td>If not null, assume that the input file has this order even if the header says otherwise.  Default value: null. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate}  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) ASSUME_SORTED (AS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>DUPLICATE_SCORING_STRATEGY (ScoringStrategy)</td><td>The scoring strategy for choosing the non-duplicate among candidates.  Default value: SUM_OF_BASE_QUALITIES. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {SUM_OF_BASE_QUALITIES, TOTAL_MAPPED_REFERENCE_LENGTH, RANDOM} </td></tr>
<tr><td>PROGRAM_RECORD_ID (String)</td><td>The program record ID for the @PG record(s) created by this program. Set to null to disable PG record creation.  This string may have a suffix appended to avoid collision with other program record IDs.  Default value: MarkDuplicates. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>PROGRAM_GROUP_VERSION (String)</td><td>Value of VN tag of PG record to be created. If not specified, the version will be detected automatically.  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>PROGRAM_GROUP_COMMAND_LINE (String)</td><td>Value of CL tag of PG record to be created. If not supplied the command line will be detected automatically.  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>PROGRAM_GROUP_NAME (String)</td><td>Value of PN tag of PG record to be created.  Default value: MarkDuplicates. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>COMMENT (String)</td><td>Comment(s) to include in the output file's header.  Default value: null. This option may be specified 0 or more times. </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_NAME_REGEX (String)</td><td>Regular expression that can be used to parse read names in the incoming SAM file. Read names are parsed to extract three variables: tile/region, x coordinate and y coordinate. These values are used to estimate the rate of optical duplication in order to give a more accurate estimated library size. Set this option to null to disable optical duplicate detection, e.g. for RNA-seq or other data where duplicate sets are extremely large and estimating library complexity is not an aim. Note that without optical duplicate counts, library size estimation will be inaccurate. The regular expression should contain three capture groups for the three variables, in order. It must match the entire read name. Note that if the default regex is specified, a regex match is not actually done, but instead the read name  is split on colon character. For 5 element names, the 3rd, 4th and 5th elements are assumed to be tile, x and y values. For 7 element names (CASAVA 1.8), the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements are assumed to be tile, x and y values.  Default value: <optimized capture of last three ':' separated fields as numeric values>. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE (Integer)</td><td>The maximum offset between two duplicate clusters in order to consider them optical duplicates. The default is appropriate for unpatterned versions of the Illumina platform. For the patterned flowcell models, 2500 is moreappropriate. For other platforms and models, users should experiment to find what works best.  Default value: 100. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
