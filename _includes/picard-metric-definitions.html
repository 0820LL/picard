 in a paired run or PAIR when the metrics are aggregated for both first and second reads
 in a pair.</div>

 this value will be 2x the number of clusters.</div>

 entirely of A bases and/or N bases. These reads are marked as they are usually artifactual and
 are of no use in downstream analysis.</div>

 aligned with low quality (i.e. their alignments are ambiguous).</div>

 alignment is wrong.</div>

 quality.  Will usually approximate PF_HQ_ALIGNED_READS * READ_LENGTH but may differ when

<div class="metric_column_def"><span>STRAND_BALANCE: </span>The number of PF reads aligned to the positive strand of the genome divided by the number of
 PF reads aligned to the genome.</div>
<div class="metric_column_def"><span>PCT_CHIMERAS: </span>The percentage of reads that map outside of a maximum insert size (usually 100kb) or that have

 In general, we are comparing two sets of alleles.  Therefore, we can have zero or more contingency table values represented in one comparison.  For example, if the truthset is
 a heterozygous call with both alleles non-reference (HET_VAR1_VAR2), and the callset is a heterozygous call with both alleles non-reference with one of the alternate alleles
 matching an alternate allele in the callset, we would have a true positive, false positive, and false negative.  The true positive is from the matching alternate alleles, the
 false positive is the alternate allele found in the callset but not found in the truthset, and the false negative is the alternate in the truthset not found in the callset.

 We also include a true negative in cases where the reference allele is found in both the truthset and callset.</div>
